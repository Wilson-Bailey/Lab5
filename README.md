Having issues importing data with the api call
Got it working 

trouble with array and list conflict something about an object cant recall exact error

Format of call is all over the place trying to format it more readable

Trying to make it where a user inserts a title of a game and it displays all relative information with that title
Running into issues where the game cannot be found no matter what

Now deciding to just display all games in a good format

FINALLY IT WORKS
